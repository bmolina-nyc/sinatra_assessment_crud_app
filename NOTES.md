NOTES

## Goal of this project 

- Nokogiri/Open-Uri the players from the yankee page
- Each player can probably be placed into a class by position?
- Pull that information down from a website and bring it into my program in some text fashion that can be stubbed out into the form I need via some class methods
- Make these players viewable and have their own individual pages - want to Nokogiri/Open-Uri their 2016 stat line
- Write a post on each players page - you can update or delete your post if it is your post.
- A Roster has many :pitchers, :catchers, :infielders, :outfielders, :DH
- A :pitcher, :catcher, :infielder, :outfielder, belong to a Roster
- A player has many stats
- A stat has many players
- I can make a table - player_stats, with a player_id, and a stat_id?
